# Tastey Bytes - Recipe Site Track Analysis ðŸš§

### Background 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a scenario based project and is part of the DataCamp Data Science Professional Exam. This section of the exam include an end-to-end coding project and a video presentataion for evaluation. 
Scenario of the project: as a data science in the data department of a given company. the client (Tasty Bytes) wants you analysis the recipes traffic to figure out what types of recipes will drive the web traffic up and building pick a machine leanring model which will predict whether a new recipe will be popular. 

### Topics:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Processing, EDA, Data Visualization, Supervised Learning. 

### How I approached this Project:
- Exam and process the data deal with outlier, missing data etc and treat each according
- EDA
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning: identity the type of machine learning problem of this project, pick 3 algorithms that are suitable for this project through grid search, find the algorithm with the best performance. and evaluate it with new recipe.

- needed to write a report. 

### Note
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due requriement from DataCamp, as this project is part of the exam. only the presentataion slide are shown here.
